# Enums

Enums lets you express a type that can be one of a few different variants. Rust's enums offer some powerful features, such as the ability to attach data to each variant (known as "associated data" or "payloads") and the ability to define methods on enums. Enums are particularly useful when you have a fixed set options that you want to express in your code.
